# LISA Dataset Generation Configuration
# 
# Realistic LISA Challenge: Detecting resolvable sources in confusion noise
#
# Training: Learn "typical LISA background" = instrumental noise + galactic confusion
# Testing: Detect rare/loud sources (MBHBs, EMRIs) in this background

# Time series parameters
duration: 3600.0  # Duration of each segment in seconds (1 hour)
sampling_rate: 1.0  # Sampling rate in Hz

# Dataset sizes
n_train_background: 1000  # Train on typical LISA background
n_test_background: 200     # Test background (no resolvable sources)
n_test_signals: 400        # Test with resolvable sources

# Resolvable signal type distribution (must sum to 1.0)
# These are the "interesting" sources we want to detect
signal_fractions:
  mbhb: 0.5              # Massive Black Hole Binaries (rare, loud)
  emri: 0.3              # Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (very rare, loud)
  galactic_binary: 0.2   # Bright Galactic Binary (common, resolvable)

# SNR range for resolvable signals (louder than confusion)
snr_range: [10.0, 50.0]

# Galactic confusion noise parameters
confusion_enabled: true
n_confusion_sources: 50  # Unresolved galactic binaries per segment
confusion_snr_range: [0.5, 5.0]  # Weak, below individual detection threshold

# Random seed for reproducibility
seed: 42
